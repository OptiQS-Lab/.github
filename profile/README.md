## We are a new research group at the Kirchhoff-Institute for Physics

Our group explores optical quantum systems to study emergent many-body phenomena.

Quantum fluids of light can be experimentally realized within nanostructured material-filled optical resonators. Utilizing the light-matter interactions in this platform, we conduct fundamental studies on thermodynamics and quantum-statistical effects. We are interested to explore how topological properties can arise in photonic structures under finite-temperature conditions, how complex networks of optical condensates can be employed as physical computers for optimization problems, or how quantum many-body states of light, e.g. photon superfluids, can be synthesised at room temperature. Unravelling such open questions is at the forefront of todayâ€™s research in quantum physics and may lead to new applications for future quantum technologies.
